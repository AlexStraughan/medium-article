      <h2>Comic sans</h2>
      <p>
        Comic Sans, created by type designer Vincent Connare in 1994, is designed to be disambiguous — that is, every letter is unique. Letters like b and d, or p and q, aren’t simply mirror images of each other, unlike in more regular fonts such as Arial. While emulating a handwritten feel, it also means those with reading difficulties can distinguish individual letters easily.

      <h2>My first git push website</h2>
      <p>
        It may be ugly, but due to the comic sans it is highly readable despite the fact that it clearly isn't.
